## Details
This is a README generator just like the one you're seeing now. It's designed to help you keep your repositories extremely organized and functional. Clarity and good understanding are essential for users (programmers or not) who will view your repositories. For this reason, I created this README generator to assist you in writing more quickly and organizedly without needing to remember tags and other annoying markdown details.
